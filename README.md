# ♻️ BINKS — Blockchain-Integrated Smart Dustbin System

**BINKS** is an eco-conscious smart bin system powered by **ML**, **IoT**, and **Web3**. It identifies, classifies, and weighs waste in real-time — and rewards users with blockchain-based **BINK tokens** for responsible disposal.

---

## 🌍 Project Purpose

The goal of BINKS is to promote sustainable waste disposal by:

- Automatically **detecting** and **sorting** waste  
- **Weighing** and logging disposal data  
- **Rewarding** users with tokens based on material type and environmental impact  
- Ensuring **transparency** via blockchain smart contracts

---

## ⚙️ How BINKS Works

1. **User scans a QR code** on the smart bin and connects their wallet.  
2. Waste is dropped into the bin.  
3. An **ML model** detects and classifies the waste (e.g., plastic, paper, metal).  
4. The bin **weighs** the waste.  
5. A **reward** is calculated using the formula:

   ```
   Reward = BaseRate × MaterialMultiplier × Weight × EnvironmentalFactor
   ```

6. The reward is **minted** as tokens on the blockchain and credited to the user's wallet.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built using [Lovable](https://lovable.so/), styled with a dark theme and green-accented UI  
- **Backend**: Supabase for database, authentication, and initiative management  
- **ML**: Waste classification API integrated with the bin's camera system  
- **Web3**: Ethereum smart contracts for token rewards and initiative deployment

## 🗂️ Pages Overview

- `/dashboard`: Overview of disposals, rewards, and user stats  
- `/smartbin`: Simulates live waste classification and token reward system  
- `/initiatives`: Explore and join community-led environmental initiatives  
- `/create-initiative`: Launch your own initiative backed by a smart contract  
- `/profile`: View wallet, disposal history, and token rewards  
- `/tokenomics`: Learn how the BINK token system works

---

## 🧮 Reward Formula

```js
BaseRate = 10 tokens/kg

MaterialMultipliers = {
  Plastic: 0.8,
  Paper: 0.6,
  Glass: 1.2,
  Metal: 1.5,
  Organic: 0.4,
  E-waste: 3.0
}

EnvironmentalFactor = 1.0 // (can be dynamic based on impact zone)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)  
- Yarn / npm  
- Supabase account  
- Lovable account  
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Backend Setup

1. Create a project on [Supabase](https://supabase.io).  
2. Set up tables for:
   - Users
   - Disposals
   - Initiatives  
3. Configure Supabase environment variables in `.env`.

### Smart Contracts

1. Deploy contracts with Hardhat or Foundry.  
2. Add the contract address and ABI to the frontend Web3 hooks.  
3. Integrate wallet providers (MetaMask, WalletConnect) for token transactions.
